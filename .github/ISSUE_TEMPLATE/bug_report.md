Software: Spotify Web Player

Bug Description:
When playing a playlist on the Spotify web player, the shuffle feature does not consistently shuffle the songs in the playlist. Instead, it seems to favor certain songs over others, resulting in a repetitive playback pattern.

Steps to Reproduce:

Open the Spotify web player in a browser.
Log in to your Spotify account and navigate to a playlist.
Click on the shuffle button to enable shuffle mode.
Observe the order in which the songs are played.

Additional Information:

Browser: Google Chrome Version 98.0.4758.102 (Official Build) (64-bit)
Operating System: Windows 10
Spotify Web Player Version: N/A (Web-based platform)

Severity Label: Medium

Justification for Severity:
The severity is marked as 'medium' because while the shuffle feature is not working as expected, it does not prevent users from listening to music altogether. However, it does impact the user experience by reducing the randomness of song selection, which may lead to dissatisfaction among users who rely on shuffle mode for variety.

This bug report addresses an issue encountered in the Spotify web player where the shuffle feature does not consistently shuffle songs in a playlist. The severity is labeled as 'medium' due to its impact on user experience. Let me know if you need further assistance!
